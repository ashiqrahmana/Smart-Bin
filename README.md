# Smart-Bin
## About
Smart Bin is a dustbin that can sort waste put by the person into 4 categories Domestic, Metal, Plastic and Glass. 
This repository consist of the model trained on such waste to effectively the sort the waste in the appropriate bins.

## Working
The Smart-Bin project focuses on developing an intelligent dustbin capable of sorting waste into four categories: Domestic, Metal, Plastic, and Glass. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller and a camera module to capture images of the trash deposited by the user. These images are then sent to a central computer, which runs a machine learning model designed to classify the waste into the appropriate category. The output from the model determines the bin in which the waste should be placed.

To ensure reliable classification, the Smart-Bin project incorporates proper lighting conditions to optimize image quality and enhance the accuracy of the waste sorting process. By combining the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, camera module, and machine learning model, the Smart-Bin aims to automate waste sorting and promote efficient recycling practices.
